## **IAP University School Management System** 

The school management system is a revolutionary platform that aims to bring efficiency and organisation to the administrative and academic functions of educational institutions. Developed using the Laravel framework, it offers a range of features that cater to the needs of students, teachers, and parents alike.

For students, the system provides access to course materials, online assignments, and assessments, allowing them to stay on top of their academic progress from anywhere. It also includes a messaging system that allows students to communicate with their teachers and classmates.

Teachers can use the system to manage their classes, create and distribute assignments, and track the progress of their students. They can also use the integrated calendar to schedule events and appointments.

The system also includes a parent portal that allows parents to stay informed about their child's academic progress and communicate with teachers.
